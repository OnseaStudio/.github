Use Ludart Game Framework (below) to work</summary><h4>Objectives[work in progress]:</h4><br>- Provide a way to use the Ludart framework quickly, by configuring as many elements as possible automatically, while allowing you to modify certain parameters and add implementations.<br>- Propose an efficient implementation of loops with their timing limitations and multithreading. It is possible in the long term that multithreading will be helped by a module on the Ludart framework side.<br>- Enhance all these elements with editors and graphic tools allowing you to configure, implement and create the resources of a video game.</details>| JAVA |
